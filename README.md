# Hi, I'm Sagar Kumar üëã

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an MCA graduate with a passion for **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Software Development**. I love solving real-world problems with data and enjoy building innovative solutions through programming. This is where I showcase my key projects, skills, and what I‚Äôve been working on lately.

## üîç About Me

I specialize in **Data Science**, **Data Analysis**, and **Machine Learning** with a strong focus on using **Python** and **SQL**. My work spans across developing **machine learning models**, creating interactive **data visualizations**, and building full-stack applications using **Flask**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**.

I‚Äôve had the chance to work with some cool technologies like **CNNs**, **LSTMs**, and **cloud platforms** like Hugging Face and AWS. I‚Äôm always on the lookout for ways to improve my coding skills and expand my knowledge in **AI** and **data-driven decision making**.

**What I‚Äôm good at:**
- Building Machine Learning and Deep Learning models
- Data Visualization using tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Power BI**
- Full-Stack Web Development using **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- Data Analysis and working with libraries like **Pandas** and **NumPy**
- Using **Git** for version control and working with **cloud platforms** like **AWS** and Hugging Face

## üíº Experience

### Data Science Intern | Codsoft (Oct 2023)
- Worked on **data analysis**, built **machine learning models**, and helped deploy them.
- Used **Python**, **SQL**, and **data visualization** libraries to deliver meaningful insights.
- Loved working with cross-functional teams to solve complex data problems!

## üöÄ Projects

### [TrustTone: Deepfake Voice Detection System](https://github.com/its-sagar)
- Developed a **Deepfake Voice Detection System** using **CNN-LSTM** and **MFCC** features to detect manipulated audio.
- Created a user-friendly web interface with **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for real-time detection.
- Achieved impressive results in identifying fake audio, and this project really boosted my understanding of **audio forensics**.

### [Nail Disease Detection](https://github.com/its-sagar)
- Built a solution for detecting nail diseases using **OpenCV**, **Scikit-learn**, and advanced image processing techniques.
- Worked with **Gabor Filtering** and **Random Forest** classifiers, achieving **86% accuracy** in classification.
- Deployed the model on **Hugging Face**, making it publicly accessible.

### [Automatic Number Plate Detection](https://github.com/its-sagar)
- Created a system that detects and recognizes vehicle number plates using **CNN** and **OpenCV**.
- Focused on image preprocessing and feature extraction, and it was really rewarding to see the high accuracy it achieved!
